  headline: Asset discovery and attack surface mapping
  content: Developers don't have visibility into what public endpoints are created
    or required by their applications once deployed.  Bloodhound includes a lightweight
    Attack Surface Mapping (ASM) implementation to continuously scan an organizations
    public assets.  Bloodhound will let you know when something doesn't meet your
    security or availability requirements before it goes to production.

  slug: Environments
  content: 90% of developers don't apply the same security to their dev and staging
    environments that they do in their prod environment.  But if the dev environment
    is a public asset, don't you want the to be secure too?  Bloodhound automatically
    compares all your environments to quickly find critical differences and suggests
    ways to fix high priority defects.
