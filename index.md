    or required by their applications once deployed.  Bloodhound includes a lightweight
    Attack Surface Mapping (ASM) implementation to continuously scan an organizations
    public assets.  Bloodhound will let you know when something doesn't meet your
    security or availability requirements before it goes to production.
